## Installation
You have two options to use PassApplication for macOS: use the Github releases or homebrew.

### Option 1: Use the Releases
Download the latest version of the app from the releases page and drop it in your applications folder.
Thats it.

> The best practice is to use your "$(HOME)/Applications" folder instead of "/Applications" folder.

### Option 2: Use Homebrew
You can install Pass for macOS using homebrew.
Just run the following command:

```
brew install --cask amine2233/tap/passapplication
```

#### Note
Homebrew installation start for `0.6.0-rc-1` release. All versions before need to use `Option 1` installation.
